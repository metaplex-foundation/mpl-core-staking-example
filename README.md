This repository provides a practical example of how to set up a staking program for your NFT collection using either Anchor or TypeScript. By utilizing the Attribute and Freeze Delegate plugins, it efficiently manages the entire staking process, from time calculations to asset state management (staking/unstaking). Instead of relying on the traditional Program Derived Address (PDA) method, this approach stores staking data directly on the asset itself.
